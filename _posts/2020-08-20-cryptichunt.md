Hello! This post contains instructional pointers for people who wish to participate in WiCS' Cryptic Hunt 2020: Waterboarded Witless.


**General Rules**

1. *This hunt is only open to Ashoka University students. All the members in your team should be currently enrolled in Ashoka University as a student. If you are an alumnus, you are welcome to participate, but you will not be rewarded for finishing the hunt.*
1. **We realise that a lot of you are confused about the registration process. We are sorry for the confusion - we have now made changes to our hunt logistics. You should be able to participate even without registering. On the hunt portal, please make sure you (and your teammate) use only one Ashoka email ID for the hunt.**
1. **You can participate individually or in a team of two. Yes, you can participate individually. It doesn't matter what you filled in the registration form. If you want to participate with another person as a team, please go ahead. There is no need to inform us if you decide to change your team.** Hope the flowchart below clarifies things:

**Additional Rules**



But what’s a cryptic hunt?
* A cryptic hunt is an online quiz that is broken down into levels of increasing difficulty (if we’re kind). Each level has a picture or text clue that you have to solve! 
* Right answers entered in the text box take you to the next level. 
* You can attempt the question any number of times, but only the right answer will lead you to the next level. 
* You can participate individually or in teams of two. However, you cannot register twice or switch between individual/team participation without informing us a priori.
* Registration is open to everyone regardless of their major or gender. 
* No technical background will be assumed. If you know how to Google to get information, you should be fine.
