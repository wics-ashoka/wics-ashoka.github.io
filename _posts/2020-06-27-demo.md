Hi! We, the women+ in computing at Ashoka University are very excited to launch our blog. We hope to share experiences, thoughts, ideas and opportunities through this platform with you. This would also serve as an archive of events and projects we want to take up this year. As we all welcome UG Batch of 2023, Team WiCS 2020-21 is very excited for the academic year.
